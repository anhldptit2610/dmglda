/* For any x in 1, 2, 3, 4 
   NRx0 - some channel-specific features(if present),
   NRx1 - controls length timer
   NRx2 - controls the volume and envelope
   NRx3 - controls the period (maybe only partially)
   NRx4 - has the channel's trigger & length timer enable bits,
          as well as any leftover bits of period
   
   There are still some exceptions
